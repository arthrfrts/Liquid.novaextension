## Language Support ðŸ“š

This extension adds supports for:

- Liquid tags and filters
- Some Jekyll-specific filters
- Liquid detectors for HTML and Markdown files
- Both Tree-sitter and Regex languages, for Novas both new and old!

Completions are in the works for the future, stay tuned!

## Thanks!

Version 2.x of this extension exists thanks to the work of @hankthetank27' [`tree-sitter-liquid` grammar](https://github.com/hankthetank27/tree-sitter-liquid). Hooray! ðŸŽ‰
